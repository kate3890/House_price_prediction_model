# House Price Prediction Model

This repository contains the code and analysis for predicting the prices of houses in the Boston area. The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview).

## Approach
To get started, I folled the following steps:

1. Download the dataset from the provided Kaggle link or access it
2. Set up a Jupyter notebook or any preferred development environment.
3. I started with a basic program that loads the data and performs initial exploratory data analysis.
4. Made decisions on variables to drop, handling null values, and performing column transformations based on the characteristics of the dataset and the problem statement.
5. Utilized any of the models for building the predictive model.
6. Refined the results iteratively by experimenting with different techniques and ideas.

## Deliverable
- A Jupyter notebook containing the code, analysis, and results.
- Resulting accuracy after performing cross-validation.
